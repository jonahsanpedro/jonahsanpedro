# Hi there, I'm Jonah! 👋

## About Me
I’m a Mechanical Engineering graduate and certified Software Engineer with nearly a decade of experience in data analysis, supply chain optimization, and 3D modeling. Throughout my career, I’ve delivered measurable results—such as boosting inventory accuracy from 30% to 90%—by leveraging technical expertise, ERP-driven data insights, and cycle count analysis to solve complex operational challenges.

My career journey began in engineering and data analysis, where I built a strong foundation in 3D modeling, process improvement, and cross-functional collaboration. Recently, I expanded into software development, completing a full-stack certification where I developed projects like:

A weather-based clothing app with React, Node.js/Express, MongoDB, and JWT authentication

A news explorer platform with React, API integration, and dynamic UI components

I thrive at the intersection of engineering and technology, leveraging both mechanical and software skills to deliver scalable, efficient, and innovative solutions. Whether it’s optimizing workflows, building user-friendly applications, or bridging technical and business needs, I bring a detail-oriented and results-driven approach to every project.

Outside of work, I’m passionate about music, especially playing drums. I’ve had the privilege of volunteering for my church’s worship team, where I combined my creativity and teamwork to contribute to meaningful community experiences.
